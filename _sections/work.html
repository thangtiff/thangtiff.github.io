			In collaboration with global cleft organization, <a href="https://www.smiletrain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Train</a>, I am 
			leading the design and development of a serious VR game aimed at providing psychosocial support to preteens with
			cleft lip and/or palate (CLP). I've worked with Smile Train's partnering psychologists and preteens with CLP 
			in North and South America to identify the psychosocial needs of preteens with CLP. Together we've created a two-player 
			game that allows the psychologist and their patient to come together to develop the patient's self-esteem and self-confidence 
			through completing quests with the help of their SuperPet Pal. User testing is currently underway and the game will be completed 
			in Fall 2022.
