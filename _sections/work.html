			<ul style="text-align:left;">
			<li><a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/cleftlip.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
			Orofacial cleft lip and/or palate (CLP)</a> is often associated with a visible facial cleft, but also 
			with psychosocial challenges, such as low self-esteem and social anxiety </li><br>
			<li>Accessing a licensed psychologist for psychosocial support 
			can be an obstacle, <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1055665618760620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 57% of US families with a child with CLP reporting that they travel over an hour away to their CLP care clinics

			<ul style = "text-align: left;">
				<li>VR interventions have shown promise in promoting improvements in self-esteem and social anxiety for individuals with psychosocial disorders </li> <br>
				<li>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.smiletrain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Train</a>, I designed and developed a serious VR game, Smile Proud, to increase access to 
					psychosocial support from a licensed psychologist</li>
