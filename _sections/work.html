			Orofacial cleft lip and/or palate (CLP)</a> 
			is a congenital condition that occurs when the lip and/or palate is not joined or completely formed before birth. 
			This condition is often associated with a visible facial cleft, but also 
			with psychosocial challenges, such as low self-esteem and social anxiety. Accessing a licensed psychologist for psychosocial support 
			can be an obstacle, <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1055665618760620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 57% of US families with a child with CLP reporting that they travel over an hour away to their CLP care clinics 
			</a>.</p>

		<h1 style = "text-align: left;">Proposed Solution:</h1><p style = "text-align: justify;">VR interventions have shown promise in promoting improvements in self-esteem and 
			social anxiety for individuals with psychosocial disorders. Psychological methods proven to improve symptoms of psychosocial disorders, such as 
			Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, are also easily translated into a VR format. In collaboration with global cleft organization,  
			<a href="https://www.smiletrain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smile Train</a>, I designed and developed a serious VR game, Smile Proud, to increase access to 
			psychosocial support from a licensed psychologist, and promote psychosocial development for preadolescents with CLP.
