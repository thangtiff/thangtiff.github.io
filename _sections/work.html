<h3 style="text-align: center;"> VR for the Psychosocial Support of Preteens with CLP </h3>  

	<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
    	<b>I am currently working with global cleft organization, <a href="https://www.smiletrain.org/">Smile Train</a>, in developing a VR game aimed at providing psychosocial support to preteens with Cleft Lip and/or Palate (CLP). </b>

    	The game focuses on aiding preteens with CLP in building and developing self-confidence and will be used as a resource in addition to existing support from psychologists and therapists. The game is a collaborative effort between myself, Smile Train stakeholders and partnering psychologists around the globe to increase access to essential psychosocial support for preteens with CLP.
