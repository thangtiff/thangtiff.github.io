                <body> Over the past 6 years, I’ve conducted UX Research, and designed and developed serious VR games with UC Santa Cruz’s <a href = "https://assist.soe.ucsc.edu/">ASSIST Lab</a>.
                    I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher leading the development and evaluation of VR games for psychosocial support with non-profit organizations for people with disabilities
                    and special needs, including <a href = "https://www.smiletrain.org/">Smile Train</a>, <a href = "https://www.hopeservices.org/">Hope Services</a> and <a href = "https://www.teriinc.org/">TERI</a>.  
                    My work focuses on understanding the psychosocial needs of individuals with disabilities and special needs, and designing and developing innovative VR solutions to promote their psychological
                    well-being and development.
