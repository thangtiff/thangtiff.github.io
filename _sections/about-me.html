            I am a Computational Media Ph.D Candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
           <b> My research focuses on developing virtual reality (VR) games that provide
           social-emotional and psychosocial support to individuals with special needs.</b> 
           I've developed VR games for adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to help with social-emotional skill training, and I am also currently working on developing a VR game to provide psychosocial support to preteens with Cleft Lip and/or Palate (CLP) in developing self-confidence skills.
