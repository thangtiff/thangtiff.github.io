            I am a Computational Media Ph.D student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
           <b> My research focuses on developing immeserive and practical virtual reality games that 
            help individuals with developmental disabilities learn, practice and strengthen social-emotional skills.</b> 
            I've worked with members of my community with developmental disabilities and behavioral specialists in 
            creating practical and relevant social-emotional skill training games for accessible VR systems, such as,
            the HTC Vive and Oculus Go. My work at the university also involves mentoring undergraduate and high school students 
            in understanding how to utilize user centered design methods in creating serious virtual reality games.
