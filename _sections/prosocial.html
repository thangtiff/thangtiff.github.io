<p style="text-align: left"> ProSocial is a branching narrative structured 360° video-based virtual reality game 
 that helps adults with autism spectrum disorders with understanding socially appropriate behaviors and social consequences
 in certain situations. Users are immersed in a social scenario where they make decisions on how they would like to interact
 with characters in the game. They are shown the social consequences of their decisions and are guided by the narrator to understand
 how they may have effected others.  </p>

    social consequences without bearing the weight of unintended negative social consequences in real life. This game was developed 
    using the Go Pro Fusion 360° video camera, DaVinci Resolve 15 and Unity. </p>
