 ProSocial is a branching narrative structured 360Â° video-based VR game 
 that helps adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with learning and practicing socially appropriate behaviors in certain situations. Users are immersed in a social scenario where they make decisions on how they would like to interact
 with characters in the game. Based on their interactions, they learn the social consequences of their choices.

 This game was developed in collaboration with Hope Services, a local community center for adults with ASD. Through interviewing and working with program managers, community and vocational support providers and members of the community center with ASD, we developed a game aimed at supporting the social-emotional skill training of adults with ASD. </p>
