<p style="padding: 5%; text-align: center"> ProSocial is a branching narrative structured 360° video-based virtual reality game 
 that helps adults with autism spectrum disorders with understanding socially appropriate behaviors and social consequences
 in certain situations. Users are immersed in a social scenario where they make decisions on how they would like to interact
 with characters in the game. They are shown the social consequences of their decisions and are guided by the narrator to understand
 how they may have effected others.  </p>
