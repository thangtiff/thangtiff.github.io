<p style="text-align: right"> Journey to Recognition is a 360° video-based virtual reality game aimed at helping 
adults with developmental disabilities in recognizing emotions in realistic scenarios by using emotional cues and
contextual clues. By incorporating 360° video into a virtual reality setting, users are able to view and learn from 
realistic emotional cues portrayed from our actors. </p>


<p style="text-align: right"> 
    Users are able to practice in a variety of settings, including studying at the library with friends, having lunch with friends
    and a job interview. Allowing users to practice identifying emotional cues and contextual clues in these settings will assist
    users with applying learned skills in the real world whenever they encounter similar situations. Journey to Recognition was developed
    using the Go Pro Fusion, DaVinci Resolve 15 and Unity for the Oculus Go.</p>
