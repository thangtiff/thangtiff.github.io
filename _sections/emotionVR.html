    <p style="text-align: left"> EmotionVR was created to assist adults with developmental disabilities in understanding how to
    identify emotions through facial expressions. Users were taught to consider character's facial features collectively
    to recognize what emotion they were portraying, as many emotional facial expressions can share certain facial features 
    (ie: frowning when sad vs frowning when angry).</p>

        I presented my work on EmotionVR at the UC Santa Cruz 2018 Grad Slam competition, where I discussed the game 
        and its impact in a 3-minute presentation competition. Work on EmotionVR has also been published in the conference 
        proceedings of ICDVRAT'18 and SMARTCOMP'18.  </p>
