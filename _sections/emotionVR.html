    <p style="text-align: left"> EmotionVR was created to assist adults with developmental disabilities in understanding how to
    identify emotions through facial expressions. Users were taught to consider character's facial features collectively
    to recognize what emotion they were portraying, as many emotional facial expressions can share certain facial features 
    (ie: frowning when sad vs frowning when angry).</p>

        We used a detective theme to encourage users to pay attention to the details on each character's facial expression, 
        as well as to provide users a fun and interesting virtual game. I presented my work on EmotionVR at the UC Santa Cruz 
        2018 Grad Slam competition, where I discussed the game and its impact in a 3-minute presentation competition. Work on 
        EmotionVR has also been published in the conference proceedings of ICDVRAT'18 and SMARTCOMP'18.  </p>
