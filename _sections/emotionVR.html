    <p style="text-align: left"> EmotionVR was a detective-themed VR game created to assist adults with developmental disabilities in understanding how to
    identify emotions through identifying facial expressions collectively. Users were taught to consider groupings of character's facial features
    when attempting to identify someone's emotion, and learned these skills through playing mini games where they searched for suspects with specific emotions.
