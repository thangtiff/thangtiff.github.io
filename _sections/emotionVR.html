        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Problem:</h3>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Individuals with developmental disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may face challenges in identifying emotions through 
        emotional cues, such as facial features, vocal intonations and body language. It is noted that in the realm of identifying emotion through facial features, individuals with
        ASD have a tendency to focus on one particular feature, such as the mouth or eyebrows. Being able to recognize emotions is a cruicial part of developing relationships with others,
        often playing a key role in maintaining friendships, romantic relationships and professional relationships.</p>

        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Proposed Solution: </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify"> In collaboration with non-profit organization, Hope Services, I developed a detective-themed VR game, EmotionVR,
            to assist adults with developmental disabilities in understanding how to identify emotions through identifying facial expressions collectively.
            I worked with support staff and clients of Hope Services to design and develop the game using user-centered design methods, including user and expert interviews,
            usability testing of various VR headsets (HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Go) and high-fidelity prototyping.
