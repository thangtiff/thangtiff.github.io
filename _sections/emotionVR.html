    <p style="text-align: left"> EmotionVR was created to assist adults with developmental disabilities in understanding how to
    identify emotions through facial expressions. Users were taught to use information from a character's facial features collectively
    to recognize what emotion they were portraying. This game was created for the HTC Vive using Unity, Blender and Fuse. </p>
