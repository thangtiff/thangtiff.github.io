        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Role: </h3> <br><p style ="text-align: left;">UX Researcher, Game Developer</p> 
        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Problem:</h3><br>
        <ul style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <li>Individuals with developmental disabilities face challenges in identifying emotions through 
        emotional cues, such as facial features, vocal intonations and body language</li> <br>
        <li>Being able to recognize emotions is a cruicial part of developing relationships with others,
        often playing a key role in maintaining friendships, romantic relationships and professional relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Solution: </h3> <br>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>VR can provide a safe, controlled and realistic method of social skills training where individuals with developmental disabilities can practice 
            recognizing and responding to emotional cues</li><br>
        <li>In collaboration with non-profit organization, <a href = "https://www.hopeservices.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hope Services</a>, 
            I developed a detective-themed VR game, EmotionVR, to assist adults with developmental disabilities in identifying emotions through collective facial features</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Methods: </h3><br>
        <ul style = "text-align: left;">
        <li>Conducted usability tests with the HTC Vive VR headset with adults with developmental disabilities, identifying pain points and design accommodations</li><br>
        <li>Interviewed users on their experiences with using VR and identifying emotions in social scenarios, using data to design game content </li> <br>
        <li>Developed high-fidelity prototypes using Unity to conduct user tests with, evaluating the impact and feasibility of the game for social skills training </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style ="text-align: left;">Results and Takeaways:</h3><br>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Adults with developmental disabilities enjoy using VR as a social skills training tool, but more realistic avatars are necessary to improve emotion recognition outcomes</li><br>
