        <ul style = "text-align: left;"> 
        <br>    
        <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/IR-01-2015-0010" target="_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)</a> are tethered, teleoperated
        underwater robots used for marine research in place of human divers in dangerous or difficult situations</li> <br>
        <li>Operating ROVs can be challenging, as operators rely on data from cameras
        and sensors, where distortion effects and lack of depth cues can make performing subsea work difficult </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Solution: </h3>
        <ul style = "text-align: left;">
        <br>
        <li>VR headsets may provide a method of viewing subsea environments more accurately than 2D screens </li> <br>
        <li> In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)</a> 
            and the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olin School of Engineering</a>, I evaluated the usability of a VR application for ROV operation</li>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Methods:</h3><br>
        <ul style="text-align: left"> 
            <li>Conducted user study evaluting the following 3 conditions: stereoscopic VR, monoscopic VR and multimonitor desktop ROV operation displays to determine ROV operation 
                efficiency with a midwater capture task</li> <br>
            <li>Used NASA TLX, System Usability Scale and Slater-Usoh-Steed Presence Questionnaire to measure cognitive task load, usability and presence for each condition</li><br>
            <li>Participants' were timed on their performance on the midwater capture tasks and were given a survey to provide qualitative feedback on 
                their experience operating the ROV for each condition</li><br>
            <li>Cybersickness was also measured using the Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire to identify any usability issues with the VR conditions </li>

    <h3 style = "text-align: left;">Results and Takeaways:</h3><br>
    <br>
    <ul style = "text-align: left;">
        <li>The stereoscopic VR condition yields significant improvements in task performance and reduces cognitive load for ROV pilots </li><br>
        <li>With the stereoscopic VR condition, ROV pilots completed capture tasks in less than half the time it took them with the multimonitor desktop condition, 
            suggesting that the implementation of stereoscopic VR controls for ROV operation could help reduce costs, as the average cost of a dive can be costly ($3600/hr)
        </li><br>
        <li>Cybersickness was reduced and presence was improved through the stereoscopic VR condition, improving the awareness of participants during ROV operation</li><br>
