        <h3 style ="text-align: left;">Problem: </h3>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/IR-01-2015-0010" target="_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs)</a> are tethered, teleoperated
        underwater robots used for marine research and in the maintainence of offshore oil and gas rigs 
        in place of human divers in dangerous or difficult situations.
        Operating ROVs can be challenging, as operators will need to rely on data from its cameras
        and sensors to provide information about the subsea environment. Distortion effects and lack of depth cues
        can make performing subsea work with an ROV difficult.

        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Proposed Solution:</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify"> 
        In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)</a> 
        and the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olin School of Engineering</a>, I worked with marine biologists, ROV pilots, 
        UX researchers and programmers in evaluating the usability of a VR application to help pilots operate underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for 
        scientific marine research. Our focus was on evaluating the differences in usability, cognitive load and task performance when comparing existing ROV teleoperation formats with 
        2D monitors to a monosocpic and stereoscopic ROV VR teleoperation interface.
