        In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)</a> 
        and the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/">Olin School of Engineering</a>, I worked with various researchers in evaluating the 
        usability of a VR application to help pilots operate underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for scientific marine research.
        Our focus was on evaluating the differences in usability, cognitive load and task performance when comparing existing ROV teleoperation formats with 
        2D monitors to a monosocpic and stereoscopic ROV VR teleoperation interface. More details on our work can be found in 
        <a href ="https://programs.sigchi.org/vrst/2021/program/content/66992"> our publication in the proceedings of VRST 2021, which won Best Paper. </a>
