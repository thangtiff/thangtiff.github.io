<p style="text-align: justify; padding-top: 15px;"> ROV VR was a collaborative project between UC Santa Cruz, the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/">Monterey Bay Area Research Institute (MBARI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.olin.edu/">Olin School of Engineering</a>. I worked with various researchers across these institutions in evaluating the usability of a VR application to help pilots operate underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for scientific marine research. </p>

  Our focus was on evaluating the differences in usability, cognitive load and task performance when comparing existing ROV teleoperation formats with 2D monitors to a monosocpic and stereoscopic ROV VR teleoperation interface.
