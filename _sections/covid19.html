		<h1 style="text-align: left;"> Problem: </h1><p style="text-align:left;">
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li>The COVID-19 pandemic caused many in-person mental health and psychological support services for individuals with developmental disabilities to rapidly shift to 
			online telehealth platforms to provide services to clients remotely
		</li><br>
		<li>With little time to translate in-person exercises to be effective for virtual sessions, it has yet to be understood what the impact of this transition 
			was like for both practitioners and their clients
		</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 style="text-align: left;">Solution:</h1><br>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li>A study was conducted with psychologists, support staff and clients at <a href ="https://www.hopeservices.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
			Hope Services</a> to understand their experiences transitioning from in-person services to telehealth</li>
		</ul>
		<h1 style = "text-align: left;">Methods:</h1><br>
		<ul style = "text-align: left;">
		<li>Conducted in-depth interviews with 10 psychologists and support staff regarding their experience using telehealth during the pandemic and translating in-person 
			exercises and treatments into a virtual format </li> <br>
		<li>Interviewed 4 clients receiving telehealth services from the organization to measure their experiences with the transition from in-person to virtual support</li><br>
		<li>Utilized thematic analysis to identify common themes within the interview data to determine what factors of telehealth were beneficial and what could be improved</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 style = "text-align: left;">Results and Takeaways:</h1><br>
		<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li>Time psychologists and staff spend with clients increased after transitioning to telehealth, more than doubling the amount of time per session spent with a client </li><br>
		<li>Technical issues, such as poor internet connectivity and lack of experience using telehealth programs, prevented clients from accessing services and increased feelings of stress</li><br>
		<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3441852.3476470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Findings from the study were presented and published in the conference proceedings of ASSETS 2021</a></li>
